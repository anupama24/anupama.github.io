Currently, I am a Phd Candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I was very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Raef Bassily. My research includes privacy-preserving data analysis, with a specific focus on differential privacy and its applications to machine learning, optimization, and adaptive data analysis.

Before joining Ohio State, I graduated with a M.Tech from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati (India) in 2013. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science & Engineering from Sardar Patel University, Gujarat (India) in 2009.
